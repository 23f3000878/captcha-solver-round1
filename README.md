# Captcha Solver

## Project Title and Description
**Captcha Solver** is a simple application designed to automatically solve standard captcha challenges. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding the mechanisms behind captcha systems and how they can be programmatically approached. 

## Features
- **Image Recognition**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to interpret and solve image-based captchas.
- **OCR Capabilities**: Employs Optical Character Recognition to address text-based captchas.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable for various types of captchas.
- **Logging**: Captures and logs attempts, successes, and failures for analysis.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the Captcha Solver on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/captcha-solver.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd captcha-solver
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Configure API Keys (if applicable)**
   - If your application requires third-party services, ensure to set up the APIs and add your keys to the configuration file.

## Usage
Run the application with the following command:
```bash
python captcha_solver.py --image path_to_captcha_image
```
Replace `path_to_captcha_image` with the path to the captcha image you want to solve. 

### Example
```bash
python captcha_solver.py --image ./captchas/sample_captcha.png
```

## Code Explanation
The core functionality of the Captcha Solver is built around:
- **Image Preprocessing**: The image is processed to enhance recognizability (e.g., grayscale conversion, noise reduction).
- **Model Inference**: The application utilizes a trained model to identify characters or patterns within the captcha.
- **Post-Processing**: Output is refined and formatted to present the final result.

Each component is modular, allowing for easy updates or replacements as better techniques become available.
